[Moderator]: Welcome to tonight's debate on the future of space exploration. Joining us are Jordan, a space policy analyst, and Taylor, an environmental advocate. Let's start with you, Jordan. Why should we invest in space exploration?

[Jordan]: Thanks for the platform. Space exploration is the key to our future. It's not just about the discovery of new worlds but also about developing technologies that benefit us on Earth. It drives innovation and inspires generations.

[Taylor]: While I agree with the innovation aspect, we must not overlook our home planet's environmental crises. Investments in space could be redirected to solving pressing issues like climate change. We have to prioritize.

[Moderator]: A valid point, Taylor. Balancing our curiosity for the unknown with the urgent needs of our planet is indeed a challenge. Let's delve deeper into this discussion.
